### ACO-based Optimal Urban Drainage Network (first approach)
* Hydraulic Modeling :—
  * The `DesignRainfall` class uses an intensity-duration curve to interpolate rainfall intensity for a given duration, enabling runoff calculations.
  * `CatchmentArea` calculates runoff coefficients based on land use and estimates time of concentration using an empirical formula.
  * `DrainageSolution` computes total runoff volume using rainfall intensity, catchment area, and runoff coefficients.
* Pipe Sizing :—
  * The `calculateRequiredDiameter` method in `Main` uses Manning’s equation to size pipes based on peak flow, slope, and material properties, ensuring capacity meets demand while respecting velocity constraints.
* Detention Facilities :—
  * `DetentionFacility` models detention/retention basins with capacity, release rate, and cost calculations.
  * The `evaluateDetentionRequirements` method selects a facility based on cost per volume, ensuring sufficient storage for 20% of runoff volume.
* Cost Estimation :—
  * Pipes: `DrainagePipe.calculateInstallationCost` accounts for material costs (from `PipeMaterial`) and excavation costs based on pipe diameter and depth.
  * Detention Facilities: `DetentionFacility.getCost` uses a base cost plus a capacity-dependent term, with different rates for detention vs. retention facilities.
  * Total Cost: `DrainageSolution` tracks the total cost by summing pipe and facility costs.
* Regulatory and Environmental Compliance :—
  * `RegulatoryStandards` defines constraints like maximum velocity, minimum slope, and minimum cover.
  * `WaterQualityRequirements` specifies limits for pollutants (TSS, oil/grease) and pH, with a sedimentation requirement.
  * The `calculateWaterQualityScore` method in `DrainageSolution` assigns scores based on HDPE pipe usage and detention facilities, though its simplistic approach (e.g., fixed increments) could be refined.
* Optimization using ant colony optimization (ACO) :—
  * Uses ants to construct solutions by selecting paths from catchment nodes to the outfall.
  * Pheromones guide path selection, updated based on solution quality (inversely proportional to cost).
  * Heuristic information combines factors like pipe length, elevation difference, drainage area, flood risk, and water quality.
  * Builds paths from catchment nodes to the outfall (node 0) using probabilistic node selection.
  * Paths are converted to pipes with calculated diameters.
  * Deposits pheromones based on solution quality and reduces pheromone levels to prevent premature convergence.
  * The implementation includes core ACO elements: pheromone trails, heuristic information, evaporation, and probabilistic path selection.
  * Parameters (`ALPHA`, `BETA`, `Q`, `EVAPORATION_RATE`) are configurable, allowing tuning of exploration vs. exploitation.
  * The heuristic combines multiple factors (distance, elevation, drainage area, water quality), making path selection context-aware.
  * Elevation factor penalizes pipes with insufficient slope, ensuring hydraulic feasibility.
  * Provides detailed metrics (cost, runoff volume, pipe utilization, water quality score), enabling comparison of solutions.
* [Repository](https://github.com/KMORaza/Urban_Drainage_Network_Optimization-ACO-Approach-1)
### ACO-based Optimal Urban Drainage Network (second approach)
* Hydraulic Modeling :—
  * `Rainfall` models rainfall with intensity (mm/hr), duration (hr), and return period (years). It calculates total runoff volume as `intensity * area * duration / 1000`.
  * `DrainageNetwork` estimates required detention volume as 30% of total runoff, using an average runoff coefficient from nodes (defaulting to 0.5 if no nodes exist).
  * `DrainagePipe` uses Manning’s equation to calculate flow capacity based on diameter, slope, and a fixed Manning’s coefficient (0.013, typical for concrete).
  * Slope is derived from the elevation difference between start and end nodes divided by pipe length (calculated as Euclidean distance).
* Cost Estimation :—
  * Pipes: `DrainagePipe.getTotalCost` calculates cost as `length * costPerMeter`, where `costPerMeter` is a constructor parameter (e.g., 100 or 120 in `Main`).
  * Network: `DrainageNetwork.getTotalCost` sums the costs of all pipes.
* Regulatory and Environmental Compliance :—
  * `DrainageNetwork` defines a `maxAllowableFlow` (e.g., 5.0 m³/s), enforced via a penalty in `AntColonyOptimization.calculateSolutionCost` (adds 1,000,000 if flow exceeds this limit).
* Optimization using ACO :—
  * Each ant constructs a solution by iteratively selecting pipes based on pheromone levels and heuristic values (inverse of pipe cost).
  * Pheromones are updated based on solution quality (`pheromoneDeposit / cost`) and evaporated to prevent premature convergence.
  * Builds a solution by selecting all available pipes in a sequence, using `chooseNextPipe` to pick pipes probabilistically.
  * The heuristic is `1 / pipe.getTotalCost`, favoring cheaper pipes.
  * Sums pipe costs and applies a penalty if the minimum pipe flow capacity exceeds `maxAllowableFlow`.
  * The best solution (lowest cost) is stored and applied to the network after optimization.
  * Evaporation and deposition are standard, with configurable parameters (`alpha`, `beta`, `evaporationRate`, `pheromoneDeposit`).
  * The best solution and cost are maintained, ensuring the final network reflects the optimal configuration.

### Optimal Damper Placement using Bayesian Optimization (first approach)
* Overview
  * Parameters of an automotive suspension system are optimized to minimize an objective function that balances:
    * Comfort (Reducing acceleration felt by passengers)
    * Vibration (Minimizing chassis displacement)
    * Handling (Reducing pitch, roll, and tire force variations)
    * Constraints (Ensuring suspension stroke stays within limits)
  * Damper placement is indirectly optimized through parameters like motion ratio, inclination angle, and damping coefficients which affect how damping forces are transmitted to the suspension system.
* Functions
  * Simulates the half-car model and evaluates the objective function for a given set of suspension parameters.
  * Compression and rebound damping coefficients (Ns/m) controls damper force.
  * Motion ratio scales the damper's effect based on its mechanical advantage in the suspension linkage.
  * Inclination angle affects the effective damping force via cosine projection while knee point, blowoff, hysteresis, temp coeff. define nonlinear damping behavior.
  * Modelling the vehicle's response to road inputs using a 10-state half-car model (sprung/unsprung masses, pitch, roll, etc.).
  * Damping forces are computed incorporating nonlinear effects like blow-off thresholds and temperature-dependent damping.
  * Outputs (acceleration, displacement, pitch, roll, tire forces, max stroke) are used to compute the objective function
  * Damper placement affects comfort (via acceleration) and handling (via pitch/roll).
  * Bayesian Optimization is utilized and it optimizes the suspension parameters by modeling the objective function with a Gaussian Process (GP) and maximizing the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function.
  * Initialization uses Latin Hypercube Sampling to generate initial parameter sets and optimization loop fits the GP to observed data, predicts mean/variance for new points, and selects the next parameters by maximizing EI over 1000 random samples.
  * All 16 parameters are optimized within bounds.
  * The GP indirectly learns how motion ratio and inclination angle impact the objective, optimizing their values to improve damping effectiveness.
  * A random road profile is generated to simulate realistic road inputs.
  * An ISO 8608-like roughness model with smoothed noise, providing displacement and velocity inputs to the half-car model is used.
  * The road profile drives the suspension dynamics, testing the damper’s ability to absorb disturbances.
  * Power Spectral Density (PSD) of chassis displacement to evaluate vibration, which is influenced by damper settings is computed.
* Optimization of damper placement
  * Motion ratio (0.5–1.5) determines how damper motion translates to suspension motion. A higher ratio increases damping force but may reduce stroke range.
  * Inclination angle (0–30°) affects the effective damping force. A smaller angle (closer to vertical) maximizes force transmission, while a larger angle may reduce wear or fit packaging constraints.
  * Damping coefficients control the damper’s force-velocity relationship, tuned to balance comfort and handling.
  * Non-linear damping parameters i.e blowoff, knee point, hysteresis, temp coefficient allow the damper to adapt to different velocities and conditions, indirectly influenced by placement.
  * Bayesian optimizer explores combinations of these parameters, using the GP to model the objective function’s response.
  * The EI acquisition function prioritizes parameter sets that are likely to improve the objective, efficiently navigating the trade-offs between comfort, vibration, handling, and constraints.
* Sample workflow
  * 10 initial parameter sets are sampled (e.g., $C_c$ = 2000, $C_r$ = 4000, motion ratio = 1.0, inclination = 15°).
  * The `VehicleDynamics::evaluateObjective` function simulates each set, computing the objective value (e.g., 5.2).
  * The GP is fitted to the initial (parameters, objective) pairs.
  * For each iteration (30 total):
    * 1000 random parameter sets are evaluated using the EI function.
    * The set with the highest EI (e.g., $C_c$ = 2500, $C_r$ = 4500, motion ratio = 1.2, inclination = 10°) is simulated.
    * The new result updates the GP, refining predictions.
  * After 30 iterations, the best parameters are returned (e.g., $C_c$ = 3000, $C_r$ = 5000, motion ratio = 1.1, inclination = 8°, objective = 4.8).
  * These values optimize damper placement (via motion ratio and inclination) and damping behavior for the given road profile and vehicle model.
