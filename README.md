| Optimal Damper Placement using Bayesian Optimization (first approach) | ◕ Overview<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Parameters of an automotive suspension system are optimized to minimize an objective function that balances: Comfort (Reducing acceleration felt by passengers), Vibration (Minimizing chassis displacement), Handling (Reducing pitch, roll, and tire force variations), Constraints (Ensuring suspension stroke stays within limits)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Damper placement is indirectly optimized through parameters like motion ratio, inclination angle, and damping coefficients which affect how damping forces are transmitted to the suspension system.<br>◕ Functions<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Simulates the half-car model and evaluates the objective function for a given set of suspension parameters.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Compression and rebound damping coefficients (Ns/m) controls damper force.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Motion ratio scales the damper's effect based on its mechanical advantage in the suspension linkage.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Inclination angle affects the effective damping force via cosine projection while knee point, blowoff, hysteresis, temp coeff. define nonlinear damping behavior.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Modelling the vehicle's response to road inputs using a 10-state half-car model (sprung/unsprung masses, pitch, roll, etc.).<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Damping forces are computed incorporating nonlinear effects like blow-off thresholds and temperature-dependent damping.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Outputs (acceleration, displacement, pitch, roll, tire forces, max stroke) are used to compute the objective function<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Damper placement affects comfort (via acceleration) and handling (via pitch/roll).<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Bayesian Optimization is utilized and it optimizes the suspension parameters by modeling the objective function with a Gaussian Process (GP) and maximizing the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Initialization uses Latin Hypercube Sampling to generate initial parameter sets and optimization loop fits the GP to observed data, predicts mean/variance for new points, and selects the next parameters by maximizing EI over 1000 random samples.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • All 16 parameters are optimized within bounds.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • The GP indirectly learns how motion ratio and inclination angle impact the objective, optimizing their values to improve damping effectiveness.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • A random road profile is generated to simulate realistic road inputs.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • An ISO 8608-like roughness model with smoothed noise, providing displacement and velocity inputs to the half-car model is used.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • The road profile drives the suspension dynamics, testing the damper's ability to absorb disturbances.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Power Spectral Density (PSD) of chassis displacement to evaluate vibration, which is influenced by damper settings is computed.<br>◕ Optimization of damper placement<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Motion ratio (0.5–1.5) determines how damper motion translates to suspension motion. A higher ratio increases damping force but may reduce stroke range.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Inclination angle (0–30°) affects the effective damping force. A smaller angle (closer to vertical) maximizes force transmission, while a larger angle may reduce wear or fit packaging constraints.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Damping coefficients control the damper's force-velocity relationship, tuned to balance comfort and handling.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Non-linear damping parameters i.e blowoff, knee point, hysteresis, temp coefficient allow the damper to adapt to different velocities and conditions, indirectly influenced by placement.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Bayesian optimizer explores combinations of these parameters, using the GP to model the objective function's response.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • The EI acquisition function prioritizes parameter sets that are likely to improve the objective, efficiently navigating the trade-offs between comfort, vibration, handling, and constraints.<br>◕ Sample workflow<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • 10 initial parameter sets are sampled (e.g., $C_c$ = 2000, $C_r$ = 4000, motion ratio = 1.0, inclination = 15°).<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • The `VehicleDynamics::evaluateObjective` function simulates each set, computing the objective value (e.g., 5.2).<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • The GP is fitted to the initial (parameters, objective) pairs.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • For each iteration (30 total): 1000 random parameter sets are evaluated using the EI function. The set with the highest EI (e.g., $C_c$ = 2500, $C_r$ = 4500, motion ratio = 1.2, inclination = 10°) is simulated. The new result updates the GP, refining predictions.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • After 30 iterations, the best parameters are returned (e.g., $C_c$ = 3000, $C_r$ = 5000, motion ratio = 1.1, inclination = 8°, objective = 4.8).<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • These values optimize damper placement (via motion ratio and inclination) and damping behavior for the given road profile and vehicle model.<br>◕ Check [webpage](https://bo-optimal-damper-placement-1.netlify.app/) about the solution and the [repository](https://github.com/KMORaza/BO-based-Damper_Placement_Optimization). |
